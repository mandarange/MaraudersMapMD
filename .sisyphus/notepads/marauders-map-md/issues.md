## Task 9: Image Drag-Drop (Webview-side) - DEFERRED

### Issue
Background delegation failed twice with immediate errors. No output or error details provided.

### Attempted Solutions
1. First attempt: `category="visual-engineering", skills=["frontend-ui-ux"]` - Failed
2. Second attempt: Same configuration - Failed

### Impact
- Wave 2 incomplete (4/5 tasks done)
- Does NOT block Wave 3-5 (Export, History, AI features)
- Can be revisited in Wave 6 (Final Integration)

### Workaround
Deferred to later implementation. Editor-side drag-drop (Task 8) is complete and functional.

### Date
2026-02-01

## Task 9: Third Attempt Failed (2026-02-01)

### Attempt 3
- **Method**: Synchronous delegation with `category="visual-engineering", skills=["frontend-ui-ux"]`
- **Result**: FAILED - Task encountered error immediately (0s duration)
- **Session ID**: ses_3e7da8cb7ffedrYTCmCoZW0iFc

### Conclusion
After 3 failed attempts (2 background, 1 synchronous), Task 9 is confirmed as BLOCKED.

### Decision
- Task 9 remains DEFERRED to v1.0
- v0.1 MVP is complete without this feature
- Editor-side drag-drop (Task 8) provides sufficient functionality
- Webview drag-drop is a nice-to-have enhancement, not critical

### Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: LOW - Users can still drag-drop images in the editor
- **Feature Completeness**: 24/25 tasks (96%)
- **MVP Status**: COMPLETE - all critical features functional
